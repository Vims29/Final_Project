Data Description
The original data had 76 variables and the dataset used has only 14. The columns names were renamed for easy understanding.Variables like chest pain , blood pressure, cholesterol etc. were used for determining the whether a person suffer from heart disease or not.

Differnt Machine learnig alogrithms were used to find the the accuracy and presision recall score.

Conclusion
The simple methods generated decent results and were useful but the complex algorithms like SVM and KNN produced better results than the simple ones. Machine learning could prove to be very useful in predicting diseases with basic information in the absence of a medical professional
